### What is/was the problem? 

The Bell Foundry area in Hastings ward is one of tshe most deprived areas in Loughborough. People who move to the area often struggle to secure furniture and other households goods and there is a significant amount of income deprivation in the area. We have helped to encourage and empower local people to become more influential and more involved in their own communities.  

One of the local residents told us how they wanted to get involved to make a difference to the lives of local people in the area:

> It has always been my dream to formalise a project that encourages recycling and upcycling, and at the same time supports vulnerable people or those in poverty. 

### How we’re helping 

We’ve worked with local residents to formally establish the “Good Gleaners Project”.  The aims of the group are to upcycle and recycle household good and clothes, and then donate these goods to vulnerable people who move into their accommodation. 
Another aim of the project is to encourage people with mental health difficulties to use their manual skills through upcycling.

### What’s different now 

The “Good Gleaners Project” is now a constituted group and the group now have their own bank account. This has enabled them to apply for and successfully gain funding for their activities.  

Their chair Fyrn says, “Thanks to the CCB development officer we’ve been able to establish ourselves as a formal group and gain funding to secure storage and a room where we can run our activities.  Good Gleaners have conducted many community stalls and donated lots of households good and clothes to vulnerable people in our community.” 

### Be a part of change in your community

If like Fyrn you’d like to make your community that little bit brighter, we’re here to help.
