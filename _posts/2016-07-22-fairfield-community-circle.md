The Fairfield estate in South Wigston is on the edge of South Wigston and has an aging population that can struggle to get out and about.

Although there are quite a few community activities in the surrounding area, there are only a few activities that actually take place on the Fairfield estate. As a result, a number of people travel out of the estate to access different activities, which means the area lacks a clear community spirit.

Kickstarter Lynda commented on why she wanted to get involved in the project:

> I would like to get involved with projects especially on the Fairfield Estate as I feel there is a need for more of a community spirit.  I've only lived in the area for just over 3 years and would love to meet more people within this area.

> I was disappointed that there were no activities other than the WI taking place at the school so I have been working with Dave Cliffe with a view to changing this. With an ageing population I think it is important that we know our neighbours and are able to meet and discuss things whether it be over a cuppa or attending an organised activity.

### How we’re helping 

We've been working with some local residents on the Fairfield estate over the last year to try to work out what people would be interested in seeing happen on the Fairfield estate and how local residents could work together to make things happen.

We have been speaking to local organisations and community groups to try to find out what kind of activities already take place in the wider area and whether there are any gaps that could be filled with new activities on the Fairfield estate. We have also been encouraging people to come forward as activity leaders to help start new activity sessions on the estate.

This led to an 'Afternoon Tea and Information Session' at the Chester Community Building at Fairfield Primary School in June 2016, with demonstrations on callanetics exercises, Nordic walking and peace education and meditation workshops. These demonstrations were well received and we are now trying to organise some pilot projects for these activities.

### What’s different now 

Lynda explained the difference the project is making in the area:

> After about 18 months hard work by Dave and input from me we hope to get the first two community activities off the ground this Autumn.  Clearly these things take time but we need you to help.

> We are now working to organise some callanetics exercise classes, some Nordic walking sessions and some peace education and meditation workshops that will take place on the Fairfield estate to make them accessible to local residents and encourage people to use the community facilities that are available on their doorstep. 

> At the same time we are encouraging more local residents and local partner organisations to come forward to share their ideas and skills to develop even more activities to bring the community together
