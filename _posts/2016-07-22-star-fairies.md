### What is/was the problem? 

The area containing Peel Drive in the Hastings ward of Loughborough consists predominantly of flats, which is common in inner cities, student neighbourhoods and poorer suburban settings. Some of the blocks of flats are in poor cleaning state and are a danger to the residents’ health and wellbeing. 

Some local residents wanted to do something to clean up the public areas both inside and outside of their blocks of flats.  

One of the residents commented on the need to improve the look of the local area: 

> It is smelly and dirty which means we can’t have family and friends visiting us and there is a danger to kids

### How we’re helping 

We’ve been working with locals residents to see how we could all work together to make their local area a brighter place to live. We helped to establish “Stair Fairies” project in close partnership with Marios Tenienti Centre and volunteers. 

The aim of this project is to help local residents to keep their communal areas clean and fulfil their tenancy agreement.  We were successful in gaining funding to buy cleaning materials and carry out cleaning sessions that are run by a group of tenants and volunteers. 

### What’s different now 

Following “Stair Fairies” cleaning session with volunteers and tenants communal areas are clean and not an obstacle to children and residents.  

Lorna, from Matios Tenienti Centre shared her views about how the project is making a difference to the local area: 

> I hope that the development of a cleaning rota will help tenants to keep their communal areas clean and safe. We are continuing our project to other block of flats in Peel Drive area.
