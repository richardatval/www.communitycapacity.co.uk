### What is/was the problem? 

Research and conversations with local residents in South Wigston over the last year highlighted the gap in services for children and young people in the area caused by funding cuts to the youth service.

Local people and local agencies also identified the high rates of crime, vandalism and anti-social behaviour and told us they feel part of the problem is that children and young people get bored because they just don’t have enough to do in South Wigston. 

Giving children and young people something to do in their area is a great way to bring them together as a group to do constructive activities and try something new.

### How we’re helping 

We’ve been working with the local community over the last year to build up a new community group and talk to local children, young people and families to find out what they would like to see happen in South Wigston.

We worked with local residents and Oadby & Wigston Borough Council’s Physical Activity Coordinator to run a ‘Have a Go’ sports day in October 2015 so that local children could try out football, cricket, boxercise, and skipping. 

We have also been working with local residents and local partners to support the development of a new community group to focus on children and young people in South Wigston. Monthly meetings have been held at South Wigston Methodist Church to bring people together to plan how to engage the community and work out people would like to see happen. This led to a taster event on 29 March 2016 on Blaby Road Park where at least 150 children and young people came along to try out sports, arts and crafts, cake decorating, and DJ sessions.

Since this event in March, we have been supporting local residents to take the project forward as a constituted group to provide regular youth activities for South Wigston.  

### What’s different now 

The Step Out! Group has now become a constituted group and has successfully applied for funding to run a 6 month pilot of the new youth club for South Wigston. 

Whilst the group is putting their policies and procedures together and waiting for this funding to come through, Step Out! is working with Oadby & Wigston Borough Council to run trial sessions of street dance and boxercise on Monday and Tuesday evenings, which started at the end of June 2016 and have had enormous interest from local children and young people.
