### What is/was the problem? 

CCB volunteers identified that the villages of Bagworth and Thornton have a high percentage of elderly people and social isolation. Social isolation is a particular issue for people who have suffered a stroke or have a disability.

Sharon, who lives in Thornton, commented on the gap in services in the area: 

> There isn’t a club or a service to support elderly people or people with a disability in Thornton. In particular, there isn’t a service for people who have been affected by stroke and their carers.

### How we’re helping 

We've supported two local residents in forming Thornton Stroke and Disability Club. Thanks to the support given, Thornton Stroke and Disability Club were able to secure funding for a year to run their activities at Thornton Community Centre. 

As part of this work, we also helped them to run an open day to launch the club at Thornton Community Centre that was attended by local parish and borough councillors who came to show their support.

### What’s different now 

Thornton Stroke Club runs their activities every Monday 1-3pm at Thornton Community Centre. Up to 15 people attend their sessions which include playing games (dominos and cards), arts and crafts and enjoying a chat over a cup of tea.

### Be a part of change in your community

If like Sharon you’d like to make your community that little bit brighter, we’re here to help.
