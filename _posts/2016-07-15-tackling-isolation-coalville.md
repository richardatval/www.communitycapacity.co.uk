### What is/was the problem? 

People who suffer from mental health problems or low confidence can sometimes become socially isolated. This can make maintaining mental well-being even more challenging and leave people out in the cold. 

The value of staying connected has been well proven, but in Coalville there hasn't been an open group that anyone could join. 

> I've always struggled with depression, and having someone to talk to would just make such a difference” said group member John. “If it could be local, that would be even better.

### How we’re helping 

While there wasn’t an open group that people could join, there was a peer support group. 

We worked with the Inclusion Support Service, Time Bank and a local volunteer named Mel to turn the peer support group into a fun, friendly group where anyone could pop by for a chat. 

### What’s different now 

Mel explained the difference the project is having saying: 

> It is very much needed in the area as somewhere casual and friendly where people can meet within a safe environment.  People from all walks of life can be together bringing different conversation and skills into the group.

> I see this group as the nucleus for other groups which may form from people making friends maybe with others with similar interests.
