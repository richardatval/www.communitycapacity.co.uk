### What is/was the problem? 

A local resident wished to use her passion and interest in growing herbs and at the same time educate people in the community about the health and wellbeing benefits of herbs. 

### How we’re helping 

We’ve supported the development of “Just Herbs” project. Thanks to this support, “Just Herbs” was able to secure some funding to buy some seeds and pots to kick-start the project. 

We are now supporting the group to become constituted and formally set up as a community group. This would allow the group to grow and go on to offer other services for their community. 

### What’s different now 

The “Just Herbs” project is running their activities at Fearon Hall Community Centre every Monday morning. Anyone is welcome to help with growing herbs and learn about the health benefits. 

These sessions are also an opportunity for people in the community to meet up and have a chat over a drink.
