### What is/was the problem? 

So many people have no idea where their food comes from or how they could possibly use it to create some fantastic meals. This is especially an issue for children, young people and families who buy their food from the supermarket and don’t see how fruits and vegetables are grown. 

There are also several areas in Wigston and South Wigston that look very built up and could do with brightening up to make the area a nicer place to live, work and visit.

Being isolated and not feeling connected with your neighbours is also a wider issue all over the country, so there is a real need for projects that can bring people from different parts of the community together.

We also want to help people to improve their confidence – we want the project to empower people to grow their own food.

### How we’re helping 

We’re working with local agencies, local residents and local businesses to bring people together and build up the project from the idea stage to a living, breathing food growing project. We have made links to local partners like the Master Gardeners, Oadby & Wigston Borough Council and Leicestershire County Council to support the project, and identify resources that could be used to develop food growing across the borough. This allowed us to start work on the Wigston Library Community Garden and the Champions Planters on the alleyway between Boulter Crescent and Bull Head Street. 

We have also started making links with local businesses, such as Sainsburys in Wigston, to seek support for the project. Sainsburys Wigston kindly donated £50 which has been used to buy some much needed watering cans so we can keep watering the new plants in the area. We have also had kind donations of tomato plants, various seeds, a compost bin and some tools that will keep this project going.

We are now working to identify other food growing spaces, find more resources to continue to build up the project and get more volunteers on board from Wigston and South Wigston.

### What’s different now 

The project is a great way to bring people from the local community together and we’re hopeful that we will be able to start growing at various other locations in Wigston, as well as in South Wigston and Oadby. Already we’ve seen how the project can bring together local residents, local voluntary groups and community workers together using their time, skills and resources.

We have now started a community garden at Wigston Library that is being looked after by several staff members volunteering some of their time. We also have four planters on the alleyway between Boulter Crescent and Bull Head Street that are currently being used to grow tomatoes. Already the area is looking brighter and getting people talking to one another – we’ve had a few people stop and ask questions when we’ve been out digging and planting.
