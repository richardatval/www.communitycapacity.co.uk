### What is/was the problem? 

People who suffer from mental health problems or low confidence can sometimes become socially isolated. This can make it even more challenging to maintain mental health and well-being and leave people out in the cold. 

It can also be difficult for people to have the confidence to go along to existing groups and activities on their own when they don’t know any of the people there. 

### How we’re helping 

Although there are lots of formal support services through local organisations and services, some of the people using these services expressed an interest in meeting new people and making new friends they could go out to try new activities with.

We worked with the Inclusion Support Service, Time Bank and some local residents to start up a weekly peer support group in the centre of Coalville that is open to anyone who would like to attend. Although the main aim at the start was support people suffering from mental health issues, such as depression and low confidence, the group has quickly evolved into a fun, friendly group where anyone could pop by for a chat. 

We’ve continued to work with the group to help make links with other social groups, think about some of the group activities people would like to get involved in

### What’s different now 

The group has been meeting weekly on Tuesday 1-3pm since December 2015 and the group has been steadily building up numbers of regular attendees. 

Celia commented on the difference the project is making to local people:

> It’s an opportunity to meet like-minded people and build up your confidence. We’re supporting each other through conversation.

Darren also commented on how the group supports people:

> It gets me out of the house for a bit, coming to a public place where people feel safe and supported. Going out in a group should be about having a laugh and a joke and meeting friendly people, which is what this group is all about.

> It’s nice to come along to something that doesn’t have the stigma of going to a formal mental health group.

### Be a part of change in your community
