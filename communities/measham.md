We’re just starting work in Measham to develop new community projects and activities.

What we’re really interested to hear about are your ideas to make your community an even better place to live. We don’t want to focus on the problems, but instead want to think about the possibilities and solutions that we could work together to take forward. The idea is that we will come out to your community to work with local residents, local groups and local organisations to help you to set up and run these community projects and activities. The key is to begin to use what is already in the community – whether it is local people who can volunteer or community space and buildings to use to run activities

If you would like to do something for your community, then we would love to hear from you!

#### Some Ideas for Possible Projects:

* Helping to set up and run activities for local children, young people and families – eg sports activities, arts and crafts, fun community events
* Helping to set up a run activities for older people – eg a coffee morning, social trips, a book club etc
* Starting a community garden to bring the community together – eg starting community food growing, building up green space and encouraging local wildlife
* Starting a support group or activity that offers help to people suffering mental health issues, people suffering from dementia or people who are carers
* Getting adults more physically active through exercise sessions
* Helping people to learn about healthy eating through community cooking sessions and meals
* Bring people together to share their skills – eg people with computer skills teaching older people to use computers or mobile phones
