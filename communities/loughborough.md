Local people have come forward to tell us that they would like to take some action to deal with several issues in the local area:

* Tidying up the area to make it look and feel better as a place to live
* Supporting the most vulnerable people in the community, in particular those with mental health issues and people in poverty
* Supporting older people in the local community
* Building up a greater sense of community spirit, particularly between different parts of the community

### What is CCB doing about those challenges? 

We've been working with local residents to find out how they think we could all work together to tackle these challenges and to use the resources and skills that are available to us:

* Starting up the Good Gleaners project to upcycle and recycle old furniture and household goods to donate to vulnerable people in the community
* Setting up the Stair Fairies project to tidy up public space around blocks of flats in the Hastings ward
* Starting up IT sessions for older people at the Bangladeshi Social Association to help them access services online and stay connected with friend and family
* Working with a kickstarter to develop the Just Herbs project to grow herbs in the area and help teach people about the health benefits of different herbs

### Be a part of change in your community

If you’d like to make your community that little bit brighter, we’re here to help.
