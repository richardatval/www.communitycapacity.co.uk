### What are the challenges faced in the local community? 

Local people have come forward to tell us that they would like to take some action to deal with several issues in the local area: 

- Not enough communication between local organisations working in the area and with the local community
- A lack of activities and services specifically for children and young people, which could be a cause of anti-social behaviour
- Social isolation of older people and lack of public transport facilities between areas in Oadby & Wigston borough
- Feeling of division between different parts of the community and a lack of community spirit in some areas
- More support for mental health and wellbeing across the area, including supporting people with mental health issues, people with dementia and people who are carers

### What is CCB doing about those challenges? 
We have been working with local residents to find out how they think we could all work together to tackle these challenges and to use the resources and skills that are available to us:

- We formed the South Wigston Working Group, a regular meeting for local groups, churches, schools and community members to come together to share information and resources and explore ways to work together
- We’ve been working with local residents and partner organisations to encourage the development of more activities for children and young people, which has led to the Step Out! Youth Group that will be running a regular youth club
- We have been working with local residents on the Fairfield estate and at Jasmine Court in South Wigston to organise specific community activities for these areas 
- We’ve been working with local residents and local partners to start up the Incredible Edible Oadby & Wigston project to bring different parts of the community together through the shared experience  of growing and cooking food in communal spaces
- We’ve been encouraging the start up of more social activities for the community across Wigston and South Wigston, including a new support group for carers in Wigston, ‘Friendly Get Together’ sessions in South Wigston and encouraging different parts of the community to come together at public events such as Christmas parties and community picnics
