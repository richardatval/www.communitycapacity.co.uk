### What are the challenges faced in the local community?

Some of the major issues that some local people have told us they would like to do something about are: 

- Social isolation of older and vulnerable people and lack of public transport facilities to help them to access different services
- Lack of activities and services specifically for children and young people
- Lack of confidence – both in terms of local people lacking the confidence to take ideas forward and low confidence in the area
- Not enough communication between local organisations working in the area and with the local community
- Not enough people come forward as volunteers to support different community activities


### What is CCB doing about those challenges?

We have been working with local residents to find out how they think we could all work together to tackle these issues and to use the resources and skills that are available to us:

- We’ve been working with some local residents and partner organisations to support people into informal social groups to build up their confidence and support networks
- We’ve been encouraging people to build up confidence in themselves and the local area through informal social groups, building links and helping people to access different sources of support and promoting the positive qualities of the area
- We’ve also been encouraging more networking between different organisations and the local community and supporting the development of the new ‘Coalville and Around’ community website
- We’ve been working with local partners to start up projects that can bring different parts of the community together, including community gardening and food growing projects that have started at some of the local schools in Coalville
- Working with some local residents and local partner organisations to see how everyone could work together to offer more activities and services for younger people in the area
