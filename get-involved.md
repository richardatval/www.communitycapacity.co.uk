There are lots of ways to get involved in the CCB project. Whatever your idea, we would love to hear from you - so don't be shy!

##  Kickstart your own project
If you have an idea for a new community project or activity you would like to take forward in one of our target areas then we’d love to hear from you. Our CCB Officer will work with you to see how we can take this idea forward. Support we can provide includes:

- Helping you start a group group to take this idea forward even if your project is informal
- Applying for funding 
- Finding groups and volunteers who might support you

##  Get Involved in an existing project
Not ready to start your own project, but still want to get involved? You could instead get involved as a volunteer on one of our existing CCB projects. This could be as simple as helping us spread the word or as involved as running a project that needs a bit of support.

##  Partner with us
If you could offer support as a partner organisation then we would be keen to see how we could work together. Maybe you have some space or resources you could share with the community or perhaps you could offer training to some of the volunteers working with us on the project. We’re keen to use the ‘assets’ available to the local community, so we would welcome your support!

##  Something else in mind?
There are lots of other ways you could be a part of the CCB project. Maybe you could link us with local businesses or help us better understand what the community needs. Whatever your idea, we’d love to hear from you.
