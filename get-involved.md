## Become a Kickstarter to start your own project

If you’ve got an idea for a new community project or activity you would like to take forward in one of our target areas then we’d love to hear from you. Our CCB Officers will work with you to see how we can take this idea forward and get other people in the community involved in your idea:

* You might want to set up a constituted group to take this idea forward, but you might want to keep the project informal. 
* You might need to apply for some funding to carry out a new activity – we can help you explore funding options and hep you to put a funding application together.
* We can help you find organisations to work in partnership who could possible support your idea and help take it forward. 
* You will probably need to get some other volunteers on board to help with this idea – again, we can help you to find some more volunteers.
* Starting a new idea can be a bit of a daunting task – you might need some moral support along the way as well, which we can help with!

## Get Involved to Support one of our existing CCB Projects

Not ready to start your own project, but still want to get involved? You could instead get involved as a volunteer on one of our existing CCB projects. 

Help us spread the word about the CCB project
Maybe you could help by spreading the word about the project and encouraging people from the local community to get involved. This could be encouraging people to get involved as volunteers, or even spreading the word about the new projects that are developing in the area.

## Work in Partnership with us

If you could offer support as a partner organisation then we would be keen to see how we could work together. Maybe you have some space or resources you could share with the community or perhaps you could offer training to some of the volunteers working with us on the project. We’re keen to use the ‘assets’ available to the local community, so we would welcome your support!

## Suggest a role you’d like to take on

Maybe you have an idea for a way you could get involved in the project but it doesn’t quite fit into the categories above. Some other ways people have suggested they could get involved have been:

* Helping us to make links with local businesses to see how they could support the community
* Helping us to reach older people in the community by visiting local older people’s groups
* Helping us find out what people think about the area by carrying out some research on social media  and in local newspapers and community magazines
* Maybe you would like to help us find out more about some of the existing projects and activities taking place in our target areas so we can help CCB projects build on the strengths of a community

These are just a few ideas for ways you could get involved in your community – but we’d welcome any other ideas you might have.
